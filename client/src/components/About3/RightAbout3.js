    Although my coding journey is my most recent venture, it feels like a
          natural fit for me, given my strengths in logic-based subjects like
          mathematics. I've become familiar with various full-stack
          technologies, including HTML, CSS 3, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express.JS,
          and MySQL. I enjoy the logical nature of setting up the backend and
          connecting the front-end elements to the back-end. Adding function to
          form and seeing a project come to life as a result of my efforts is
          extremely satisfying.

        More recently, I've also started learning C# within Unreal Engine,
          which has been an exciting new challenge. With my graphic design
          abilities, love of gaming, and newly developed coding skills, I see
          exciting opportunities to integrate these passions into a single
          package. By exploring new areas of the tech world, I hope to continue
          developing my programming skills and discovering new opportunities for
          growth and creativity.
