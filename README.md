## Building my website
My main struggle was getting design ideas for how I wanted to portray myself in my portfolio. Between a more casual or formal approach was where the issue lay. I decided to go with more of a professional format to show employers my dedication and seriousness about my programming abilities. I am happy with the outcome of my website and have more ideas on how to alleviate it.
